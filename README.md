# Online Code Runner

### A lightweight LeetCode-style editor + sandbox for technical interview practice.

This project is a browser-based coding environment designed for algorithmic challenges and interview prep. It provides a minimal interface for writing Python code, running custom test cases, and evaluating line-by-line results — without the overhead of parsing input().
